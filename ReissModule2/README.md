==**Winold Reiss**=={Q344838} was a modernist portrait artist from the first half of the 20th century. This essay explores how his artwork reframed the public perspective on African American and Native American populations in industrial America. 

# *Langston Hughes*

Reiss's portrait, *Langston Hughes*, portrays Hughes as a thoughtful, professional leader of the Harlem Renaissance. The background of the portrait suggests African American contributions to music, poetry, and industry - a break from traditional portayals of African American stereotypes in art.

Both of these works represent Reiss's work in Harlem and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation during the roaring 1920's. At this time, African Americans and Native Americans were underrepresented in American portraiture. Reiss, an immigrant from Germany with strong modernist influences, sought to represent influential leaders and regular community members from both populations. In the left image from "*The New Negro*",  a book documenting the Harlem Renaissance in realtime, Reiss highlights the community aspect by representing this image of mother and child between portraits of W. E. B. DuBois and Langston Hughes. In the image on the right, Reiss profiles Night Woman, a Blackfeet community leader. In his work creating images for the Great Northern Railroad and for Glacier National Park, Reiss attempted to present honest images of the entirety of the Blackfeet tribe. The little recognition Reiss has received has largely been attributed to his desire to represent non-white audiences. Jeffrey Stewart from the Reiss Foundation puts it plainly, "In some respects, his devotion to drawing and painting non-white subjects minimized his work within the American art establishment. His idealism challenges the notion that as Americans we are anything less than "us," a totality that includes rather than excludes."[^1] Over the course of his life, Reiss painted 250+ portraits of the Blackfeet tribe, with his earliest recorded in 1920 and his last in 1948.[^2] 

Reiss documented influential cultural aspects of both the black residents of Harlem and the Blackfeet tribe of Montana. Reiss documented influential poets, authors, and other literary and musical contributors to the Harlem Renaissance. In Montana, he sometimes captured cultural ways of life of the Blackfeet - as seen in his painting *Man and Woman Sign Talking* which documents the Blackfeet tradition of communicating through sign language.[^3] In a 2024 exhibition at the Met, curator Denise Murell described Reiss's portrait of Alain Locke as "a study of a thinking person, a Black man who's engaging the viewer in a direct exchange, an exchange of equals. There's no subordination. There's no sense of putting on a face, the performance face. We're able to see the intellectual and aesthetic engagement of this foundational thinker of the Harlem Renaissance." [^4]

# **New York Historical Society 2022 Exhibit**
There have been few large scale exhibitions of Reiss's work, however the New York Historical Society gathered multiple of his works from public collections, with special highlights of his portraits for "*The New Negro*" book he illustrated for Alain LeRoy Locke - the "Dean" of the Harlem Renaissance.

The vast majority of Reiss's portraits of the Blackfeet remain in the collection of the BNSF Railway (formerly the Great Northern Railway).[^5]
